#### Editing a message

If the content of a previously sent message should be edited, a generic message of type `MessageEdit` has to be sent. It should reference the new content (for now only type `Text` can be edited) as well as the nonce of the message it is replacing. If an edit message is received which is referencing a non existent nonce it should be discarded.
